  <p>Hello World.</p>

  <p>At the moment I am using my experience in health services and web development to build a strength training,
    ergonomics, and meditation app. I have always enjoyed supporting roles and seeing those around me thrive. I really
    enjoy collaborative learning environments with colleagues who share a passion for learning. I value technology as a
    means of promoting preventative care and public health.</p>
